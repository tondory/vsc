                      Many people think of budgeting as its only for poor people, so they try to avoid it because they don't want to feel that way.<br>
                      We have searched a long time for a good definition and we believe it is using money in a responable and efficient manner.
                      It means you take choices with what happens with your money before you actually are on the edge of spending. <br>
                      Budgeting is very important to maintain a healthy finance! <br>
                      Anyone budgets even children! <br>
                      When a child gets some money from its parents it will choose (for example) to spend that money on candy, or save it for later.
                     <br> Budgeting makes it easier for people with incomes and expenses of all sizes to make conscious decisions about how theyâ€™d prefer to allocate their money. It can also help people to save for what they've always wanted!
